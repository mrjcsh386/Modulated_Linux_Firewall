All the files found within this directory should be considered as a catalogue
to pick and choose from for the point and purpose of adding elements to the
firewall. You might find it interesting that most of the variables can be pre-
occupied with values, enhancing by hand deployments of new rules to run along
side of already existing rules. As time progresses, you should begin to notice
different versions listed in this directory. Some versions will handle different
gradients of paranoiha and postures. I'm attempting to give you a big box of
legos!
